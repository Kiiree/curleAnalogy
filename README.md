# Curle Analogy

This is a implementation of the modified Curle acoustic analogy presented by Larsson et al. [1] implemented as functionObject for OpenFOAM 3.0.x. The method is implemented for incompressible cases including the surface and volume integrals.

The repository includes the source files for compilation. Furthermore, mesh and setup for the tandem cylinder validation case are provided [2].
